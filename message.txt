HEY! This is a modified version of FNF!
I would like to qualify some things.
1. This is early in development, 
  so don't complain about it too much.
2. I will not be posting the source as if right now. 
  It is not yet entirely playable.

---EDIT OF 2/18/22:

-With the use of Polymod, the game's assets
can be switched out much quicker!
-You go to 'mods/modList.txt' to change the current mods.
As if in the new update (you have it),
There is a B-Sides mod already installed.
To enable mods, add them to the list. (CaSE SENsITiVE!)

---EDIT OF 6/3/22:

SETTINGS UPDATE:
LOCAL MULTIPLAYER (VERY W.I.P.)!!!
(Click the button next to the option to enter 
player 2 controls)

-You can add custom characters 
(example installed to mods folder already)
-You can make and change icons 
(example installed to mods folder already)
-You can make custom songs, and also make and change weeks!

--EDIT OF 9/18/22:

MOD SUPPORT UPDATE:

custom characters, a mod toggle switch, and more!
