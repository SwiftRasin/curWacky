HEY! This is a modified version of FNF!
I would like to qualify some things.
1. This is early in development, 
  so don't complain about it too much.
2. I will not be posting the source as if right now. 
  It is not yet entirely playable.

EDIT:

-With the use of Polymod, the game's assets
can be switched out much quicker!
-You go to 'mods/modList.txt' to change the current mods.
As if in the new update (you have it),
There is a B-Sides mod already installed.
To enable mods, add them to the list. (CaSE SENsITiVE!)

Thats all for now!
